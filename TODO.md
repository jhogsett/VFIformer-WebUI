### to do list

[ ] look into referencing VFIformer inside an intact subdirectory
[ ] see if a mention is needed of VFIformer license since I borrowed code
[ ] incorporate use of Real-ESRGAN tool for frame restoration/upscaling
[ ] clean up multiple util files in root directory
[ ] do I need the "fix gradio phoning home" fix like in automatic1111?
[ ] text file in the "run" directory with details like exact original filenames

Experiments

[ ] can some lost detail be recovered with multiple passes? Idea: use frames created adjacent to the outer frames + re-interpolation of some frames to try to bring that detail towards the center frames, where it's lost the most.
