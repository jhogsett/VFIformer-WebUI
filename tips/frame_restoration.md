- _Frame Restoration_ uses _Frame Search_ to create restored frames for a set of adjacent damaged ones
- The count of damaged frames and a pair of outer _clean_ frames are provided
- _Targeted interpolation_ is used to resynthesize a set of replacement frames at precise times

# Important
- Provide only CLEAN frames adjacent to the damaged ones
    - The frames should not cross scenes
    - Motion that is too fast may not produce good results
- Set _Frames to Restore_ to the exact number of needed replacement frames for accurate results
- _Frame Search Times_ shows the fractional search times for the restored frames
    - Example with 4 frames:
    - If there are 2 good frames _A_ and _D_ and 2 bad frames _b_ and _c_:
        - A---b---c---D
        - Replacement frame B is 1/3 of the way between frames A and D
        - Replacement frame C is 2/3 of the way between frames A and D
        - _Targeted Interpolation_ creates synthesized frames at these precise times
- Set _Search Precision_ to the _search depth_ needed for accuracy
    - Low _Search Precision_ is faster but can lead to repeated or poorly-timed frames
    - High _Search Precision_ takes longer but can produce near-perfect results
- _Predicted Matches_ estimates the frame times based on _Frames to Restore_ and _Search Precision_
    - Actual found frames may differ from predictions
    - A warning is displayed if _Search Precision_ should be increased due to repeated frames
