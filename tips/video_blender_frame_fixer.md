- When arrving at this tab via the _Frame Chooser_ Fix Frames button, the following fields are pre-filled from the project:
    - Video Blender Project Path (PNG files for video being blended)
    - Last clean frame BEFORE damaged ones (current frame from _Frame Chooser_)

# Important

- _Last clean frame BEFORE damaged ones_ MUST be the last clean frame before the set of damaged ones
- _First clean frame AFTER damaged ones_ MUST be the first clean frame after the set of damaged ones
- Frames may not be fixable if there's a scene change, motion is too fast, or the clean frames are too far apart
